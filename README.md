Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on the Bayes theorem, which states that the probability of an event A given that another event B has occurred is equal to the probability of event B given that event A has occurred, multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. Here is an example of how you could implement a Naive Bayes classifier in C++
